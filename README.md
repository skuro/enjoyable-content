This is a collection of Groovy scripts intended to be used in the [OpenCMIS Workbench] to handle content.

Installation
============

You can just clone this repository on your machine, then start the Groovy console from the Workbench and open the script you want to execute.

Most of the scripts will need some customizations in order to be useful, e.g. by setting a path or a configuration option. Be sure to read the script carefully before you run it against your production environment, there's no refund policy!
